* Overview

I built this because I saw people posting their Bloomberg terminals.

The data is sourced from the [[https://developer.edgar-online.com/live][Edgar]], and is free but requires an API key (setup is easy).

Windows, Mac & Linux binaries available below:

[[https://tavurth.itch.io/gme-institutional-ownership][itch.io link]] to the downloads

* Features

- Sorting (click on the headers)
- Multiple data sources available
  - Edgar API
    This seems to be up to date based on the NASDAQ results but fintel has a bit more data

  - IEX Cloud
    Seems to be more up to date than Edgar but costs $9 per month

** Shortcuts

- Instrument picker (press ~i~)
- Reload the data at any time (press ~ctrl + r~)

* Setup

There are different data sources available, and you'll be presented with a choice when you first start the app.

Both options require that you sign up for a service, Edgar is free but the data may be delayed a few months, wheras IEX Cloud should be up-to-date but costs $9 per month.

Please make sure you have allowed the app access through your firewall.

* Development setup

1. Download [[http://godotengine.org/][Godot]]
2. Import the project from the first window which appears
3. Press the play button at the top


* Contributing

Contributions are very welcome! Together perhaps we can make this grow into something beautiful ðŸ™‚

Please keep your ~Nodes~ as independant as possible, they should connect to other nodes with [[https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/step_by_step/signals.html][Godot Signals]] wherever possible as this keeps refactoring of different modules easy.

Please keep keyboard shortcuts in the [[https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/classes/class_inputmap.html][Godot input map]].

Please squash all commits into a single commit so that we can read without much difficulty.
